Autocheck is a source code analysis tool based on Clang / LLVM infrastructure.

Its main purpose is to check code against AUTOSAR guidelines for the use of the C++14 language in critical and safety-related systems. The main application sector of these guidelines is automotive, but these guidelines can be used in other embedded application sectors.
